Given sample CSV's of online and offline donors, write code to compute the aggregate giving totals required to render leaderboards on a fundraising campaign.

-------------------

## Designation Leaderboard

Build a service that outputs the donors and dollars for each designation.

**Online Donors**: `designation.key` is the designation, and `designation.value` is amount

**Offline Donors**: `designation_name` is the designation, and `designated_amount` is the amount

**Example:** Scroll down to the `Team Leaderboard` visual on [**this campaign**](https://www.givecampus.com/schools/WhitmanCollege/game-on).

-------------------

## Affiliation Leaderboard

Build a service that outputs the donors and dollars for each affiliation year.

**Online Donors**: `affiliation.value` is the affiliation's value, `dollars` is the amount

**Offline Donors**: `affiliation` is the affiliation's value, `dollars` is the amount

**Example:** Scroll down to the `Class Leaderboard` visual on [**this campaign**](https://www.givecampus.com/schools/HoldernessSchool/2021-day-of-giving).
